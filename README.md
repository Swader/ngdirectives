ngdirectives
============

### Note: see angular-ui instead. This repo will soon change to include directives not found there.

Various AngularJS directives I frequently use and need.

### How to use

Look around the src folder for directives that might be of use to you. Every directive is a separate file, and well commented on how to use it and what it depends on, if anything.

### Contributing

I'll gladly take pull requests.

### Usage

Feel free to use these components for absolutely anything. Linking back to source repo not necessary, but welcome.
